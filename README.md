Running the API Endpoints

_You will need [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to run tests on api endpoints:_
1. Start the api server through your terminal by running _python routes.py_
2. Start up postman. (Through postman, you can emulate all http verbs('PUT', 'GET', 'DELETE', 'POST',etc) as shown in screenshots below.
