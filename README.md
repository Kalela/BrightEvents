Installation
============
1. Clone the Github repository:
    >$ git clone https://github.com/Kalela/BrightEvents.git
2. Install pip
    >$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
    >$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
3. Install virtualenv
    >$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
4. Set up autoenv using pip and create a .env file for it to access every time this path is accessed.
    >$ pip install autoenv
    
![env](https://image.ibb.co/f75eUw/Screenshot_from_2018_01_04_15_48_41.png "env")

Every time this directory is accessed, the commands are excecuted to set up the FLASK_APP and other environment variables.
5. Set up a virtualenv 
* In this case, _virtualenv venv_
  (If you can't see the .env file make sure your file explorer has viewing hidden files enabled)
    >$ virtualenv venv
* Run the following to update and refresh your .bashrc:
   >$ echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc
   >$ source ~/.bashrc
    
   * cd Out of the folder and back in to get autoenv up and running and thus your virtualenv venv activated.
   
6. Install all application requirements using pip
    >$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    _To check if installed run pip freeze to see all installed packages_
    
Designs
-------
All front end designs are located in the designs folder.

Running the API Endpoints
-------------------------
1. Run a terminal such as cmd on windows or terminal on ubuntu.
2. cd into main folder and run command flask run. This should start the server to our Event Hub RESTful api on port 5000.
    >$ flask run
    
![CMD](https://image.ibb.co/jSxZNG/Screenshot_from_2017_12_29_20_58_25.png "Bright Events")
   If your lucky (*winks*) You won't get any errors and server will be up on localhost port 5000.
![CMD](https://image.ibb.co/d1Q79w/Screenshot_from_2017_12_29_20_46_38.png "Bright Events") 
   
3. Now you can test your endpoints using Postman or Curl.
Your good to go.

Tests
=====
_You will need [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to run tests on api endpoints:_
1. Start the api server through your terminal by running _flask run_.
    >$ flask run
2. Start up postman. (Through postman, you can emulate all http verbs('PUT', 'GET', 'DELETE', 'POST',etc) as shown in screenshots below. For Postman installation, search for appropriate documentation.

##### Test Driven Development #####
1. cd Into the main directory.
2. Run python tests.py to run tests on Bright Events Website RESTful apis.
    >$ python tests.py
